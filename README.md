6.Development Status: Still on-going
While the project is pushed into Github, the website is still under-development due to many personal reasons: mental health issues to take a break, revision for coding knowledge again after graduation, etc. to bugging issues during building process as this project was built only one person. The website still contains main functions first, then debugging later to that they can work properly before moving to next steps. The development will still maintain and will be done in the future, with better UI and fully functional features.
